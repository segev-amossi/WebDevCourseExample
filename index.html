      <h1>H.N. Bialik</h1>
      <p>A Jewish poet who wrote primarily in Hebrew but also in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish">Yiddish</a></em>.
        Bialik was one of the pioneers of modern Hebrew poetry.

      <p>
        Bialik was born in Ivnytsia [uk], Volhynian Governorate in the Russian Empire to Itzik-Yosef Bialik, a scholar and businessman from Zhitomir, and his wife, Dinah-Priveh.[2] He had older brother Sheftel (born in 1862) and sister Chenya-Ides (born
        in 1871), as well as a younger sister Blyuma (born in 1875).[3] When Bialik was still a child, his father died. In his poems, Bialik romanticized the misery of his childhood, describing seven orphans left behindâ€”though modern biographers believe
        there were fewer children, including grown step-siblings who did not need to be supported. Be that as it may, from the age 7 onwards Bialik was raised in Zhitomir by his Orthodox grandfather, Yankl-Moishe Bialik.
